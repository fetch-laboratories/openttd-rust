# OpenTTD-Rust near-term roadmap

Root owns selection here; `AGENTS.md` and `docs/rust-migration.md` define process.
If an issue conflicts, follow this roadmap and report it to root. Keep this
forward-looking, about 200 lines; completed work is one row, with evidence in PRs.

## Where the fork stands (2026-10-24, code at `268c7c140d`)

- Fifty-six ownership ports. Original retirement: 59,788 / 470,612 C/C++ src lines (12.70%); simulation 51,422 / 102,615 (50.11%). Whole-fork Rust/tooling/glue: 108,442 / 39,106 / 38,636. Source-line measures include comments/data, not completed behavior percentages.
- Since the seventeenth steering: 18 owners, 10,152 original lines retired, 4,239 net glue and 7,015 tooling lines added. #415 integrates vehicle #397, industry #407, metadata #413 and bribe coverage #414. #412 integrated storage #400, structures #405 and metadata #408; earlier batches remain recorded below. No rollback.
- Latest completed profile at 6bb, with BOTH 6a and 6bb using quiet-ac7 anchors: TGP 1.123906x; Opus 1.456272x; Grok 1.443931x; P1996 1.343440x; P2000 1.413525x; P2016 1.484664x. Counts rose 0.008-0.345%; only TGP projection rose, by 0.021%. No >3% trigger; these are not wall savings. Next profile is due after the next integration, the second since this assessment.
- Repaired-tip quiet 6bb pass: TGP 1.125882x; Opus 1.408100x; Grok 1.403127x; P1996 1.321189x; P2000 1.377896x; P2016 1.455912x. Four interleaved three-pair medians, all 144 exits/72 semantic pairs passed. Prepared before the actual hold and released at the final exit; no competing builds/profiles/games. All below ceilings; only P2016 remains in band. Its current net attribution selects aircraft positioning, scheduler orchestration and pixel-height compiler/boundary repairs on #275. Costs include necessary work, not promised savings. New anchors are queued in shared maintenance; recompute both tips under those anchors.
- Integrated combinations passed exact-current-base Full. Since steering: 34 Full requests, 19 successful, nine failed and six cancelled. #415's frozen industry loader repair passed fresh review and final Full. Strict protection is enabled. Both due macOS configurations passed at 6bb; next run is due after four integrations. CI maintenance observation is 9/10. CI_ON_DEMAND stays true.
- Six unintegrated components: reviewed station #411; preserved house/town #416 awaiting shared helpers/candidate checks; selected road-stop #410; one shared-helper/anchor batch; one speed-repair batch; one standing #156 coverage batch. Following whole Action2 #417 and airport #418 owners are selected and queued. Completed checkouts are removed under #259; protected speed inputs remain until consumed.

## Eighteenth steering review (2026-10-23, remove accidental gates and close shared-layer debt)

Four fresh Codex gpt-6.1-sol/high fidelity audits covered the largest new ports:
#364 generation (1,214 retired), #374 movement (985), #360 rail transactions (864)
and #359 visits (769). A fifth audited process and blockers. These share root's
model family at the user's request; the Opus tasks were stopped. Root verified
load-bearing findings against source, retained reports and transcripts.

- No reachable game-state divergence established. Autorefit restoration allocates a fresh Vec where original assignment reuses capacity. Strict graph lookup was replaced with GetIfValid; ordinary dangling-ID reachability is unproved. Named helper copies and duplicate native leaves remain. Fixing checklist: [#261](https://github.com/fetch-laboratories/openttd-rust/issues/261#issuecomment-6370620352).
- Animation's evidence caught a real airport RNG/SB defect before integration. Keep its accepted package. Nine animation tasks (three planning/inventory), six scheduler tasks and four monitor tasks repeatedly tried to force ratios before accepting necessary boundaries. The infrastructure budget rule had been extended to ordinary owner evidence; AGENTS.md corrects that scope.
- A ready #387 Full waited about 90 minutes for future speed maintenance. Quiet leases covered about 33 minutes for roughly 7.5 minutes of collection. The private 0.25-core cutoff aborted 66 games when an unrelated process used 0.267856 core; no calibration established timing contamination. AGENTS.md restores readiness order and confines holds to actual measurement.
- The speed report compared ac7 against 824's OLD-anchor projection. Recomputing both from the current anchor gives play rises of 4.33-5.37%, not the three previously reported. #275 is the authoritative correction and work list.

Standing corrections from reviews sixteen/seventeen and the later user correction:

| Correction | Verdict and cost versus result |
| --- | --- |
| Merged-tip profiles; no per-PR speed; band-only passes | Applied; identified real cost growth and selected #390. Nonblocking interpretation slipped as above. |
| Strict tested combinations and batching | Applied after the #347/#353 failure; later failed combinations stayed off main. Keep it. 27 Full requests still cost six failed/six cancelled attempts. |
| macOS every fifth integration; focused local checks/free-core jobs | Applied; both due latest-session macOS runs passed without capacity cancellation; no duplicate full local suite found. |
| Infrastructure budgets; proportionate owner evidence | Harmful reinterpretation into three owner ledgers; repeated planning stopped at the same eventual cost explanation. Scope corrected in AGENTS.md. |
| Header helpers, base-type returns, local containers and orphan review | MSVC/scratch fixes landed and reviews removed orphans; helper copies and one allocation slipped through. #261/#281 fixes are selected. |
| #156 standing capacity and #281 tail | Slipped; no dedicated backlog task in the latest session. Assign maintenance/coverage workers before another evidence planner. |
| Clean-base review exemption; stock-take docs | Slipped around clean reconciliation (#380 had an empty remerge diff but another review). Six integrations produced 16 docs commits; use existing exemption and selection/stock-take cadence. |
| Checkpoints, action-based wind-down and rollback | Applied: three unfinished checkpoints preserved; no new CI wait. No eligible rollback in the latest session. |

Disposition: #403 integrated the selected source/checker and coverage fixes plus
three repairs from the completed #275 net attribution. The full quiet-six retry
is complete. #389's probes and base conflict resolution passed fresh scoped
review and integrated exact-current-base Full. Standing #156 work and #259 cleanup
continue. No new profiling controller, raw-map/Vehicle permission or owner cost
ledger was introduced. Its [accepted disposition](https://github.com/fetch-laboratories/openttd-rust/pull/389#issuecomment-6370622209)
remains settled; ready owners do not wait for future speed maintenance.

The 3% trigger and factor 2 remain provisional: observed reference count drift is
about 0.055%, far below this tip's 2.17-2.68% play-work growth. At 032d the factor-2
projections exceeded quiet play ratios by 9.55-19.36%; keep using quiet passes to
decide actual ceiling proximity, not treating projections as wall results.
No user speed/CI/wind-down policy is reversed. The removed gates were agent
interpretations. The requested whole quiet-six retry is now complete. The steer skill
uses the active host's native subagents, whether Codex or Claude Code;
the start-development prompt is unchanged.

## Earlier steering, still in force

Ownership and original observable behavior come first; C++ retains canonical map
arrays except the explicitly audited #274 read descriptor. Preserve original
callees, shared helpers/services, process scope and RNG. No per-call allocation
absent from the original, opcode dispatch, whole-record copies or owner bounces.
Evidence is default semantic checks plus exact-combination CI, with gaps on #156
and original retirement excluding glue (#223). Small maintenance is batched;
reviewers fix source findings and rerun only affected checks. Keep six component
branches maximum, strict protection, no admin merge, automatic bounded rollback,
and action-based wind-down. AGENTS.md is the authoritative rule text.

## Phase 1: selected maintenance and coverage

The semantic harness remains the evidence base. #261/#281 own source-boundary
repairs, #156 owns missing branches, and #275 owns the measured speed work.
Their current selections and readiness order follow below; no separate gate or
new tooling stream is introduced. Keep one worker closing the coverage backlog.

## Phase 2: current work, in order of readiness

Integrate ready reviewed work first. Keep at most six component branches.

1. **#399 / #411 station/waypoint resolver:** whole-owner fixing review and root spot-check pass at d35afa82c5. Root's minimal #261 shared ConvertState/base-scope and quiet-anchor batch starts from integrated 268. Prepare one combination with canonical real-group/airport/helper adoption and scoped resolution review, then current-base Full; no repeated whole-owner review/cost gate or serial Full for shared services.
2. **#409 / #416 house/shared-town resolver:** whole source/default fixtures preserved at 2e7d2e665c; cost accepted once. Reference house/reload pass, candidate remains unvalidated. Adopt actual integrated helpers/metadata, finish build/Cargo4/default comparisons/audit, then fresh fixing review and Full. No temporary parallel helper or unmerged base adoption.
3. **#410 road-stop resolver/spec associations:** active from integrated 268. Own stack/root/cargo/lazy parent, complete triggers and association lifecycle over native vectors. Require the selected real availability/reseed/command lifecycle checkpoint and once-only cost disposition; final common station policy adoption calls Rust directly.
4. **Speed #275, coverage #156 and cleanup #259:** implement the three net-ranked repairs in one batch; ready owners proceed while prepared. Standing coverage worker closes one remaining integrated-owner gap outside active resolver/speed fixtures. Shared maintenance records measured six anchors; root profiles every second integration and remeasures after fixes. Keep protected inputs; broader CI tooling stays unselected until observation 10/10.
5. **Queued #417 common Action2, then #418 airport/airport-tile resolution:** fresh Astra/high planning verified whole remaining gameplay runtimes, direct existing owners and real default fixture plans. Issue scopes define concrete checkpoints and fidelity/native boundaries; start by readiness/capacity. No utility/GUI fallback or draft-service dependency.

New owners start from integrated rust-migration, never draft services. Root lands
a shared service once, and other drafts adopt it when preparing final validation.
Core owners receive concrete boundary repair or a necessary-cost explanation,
not circular deferral. Catchment, #64/#68/#69, vendored libraries, GUI rendering
and platform expansion remain unselected. Plan the next whole simulation owners
when the existing restart loop calls for it; completing this list does not stop work.

## Resume checkpoint

Development is active. #415 merged after the repaired exact-current-base Full.
Minimal shared services unblock the reviewed station and preserved house owners;
source repairs, road-stop ownership and standing coverage proceed independently.

| Item | Saved head | Resume action | Jobs / CI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #411 station resolver | `d35afa82c5` | Canonical adoption/combination scoped review, then Full. | Whole review/root spot-check pass; no local jobs. |
| #416 house/town | `2e7d2e665c` | Integrated helpers, fresh completion checks, then review. | Preserved clean; candidate unvalidated. |
| #261 shared / #275 anchors | base `268c7c140d` | Minimal goods/base scope; record measured six anchors. | Fresh implementation active. |
| #410 road-stop | base `268c7c140d` | Complete owner; real callback/association checkpoint. | Fresh implementation active. |
| #275 speed repairs | base `268c7c140d` | Aircraft/scheduler/pixel fixes; root assesses merged tip. | Fresh implementation; no timed hold. |
| #156 coverage | base `268c7c140d` | One remaining integrated-owner gap and targeted mutations. | Fresh standing worker active. |
| #417 / #418 | selected | Common Action2 first, airport runtime second. | Queued, not started. |

Preserve speed checkouts `af1fea6a`, `bf961767`, `72a1223d`, `7ece2878`, `2a35b1c0`
and their exact runtime until #275 consumes them. Keep the pinned reference
unchanged. Current root is gpt-6.1-sol xhigh; implementation/review workers use
Sol high and planning uses Astra high. CI_ON_DEMAND stays true; macOS is due
after four integrations. Old wind-down messages bind only the stopped session.

## Progress metric

Every port PR records `python3 tools/port-metrics.py`; `--whole-fork` gives totals
and simulation share. Retire more original C++ than net glue plus tooling or
explain the necessary cost after boundary review. Data tables inflate retirement;
judge game logic owned. AGENTS.md governs cost disposition and evidence scope.
