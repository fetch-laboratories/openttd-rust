# OpenTTD-Rust near-term roadmap

Root owns selection here; `AGENTS.md` and `docs/rust-migration.md` define process.
If an issue conflicts, follow this roadmap and report it to root. Keep this
forward-looking, about 200 lines; completed work is one row, with evidence in PRs.

## Where the fork stands (2026-10-24, code at `1569158485`)

- Fifty-nine ownership ports. Original retirement: 61,148 / 470,612 C/C++ src lines (12.99%); simulation 52,782 / 102,615 (51.44%). Whole-fork Rust/tooling/glue: 111,409 / 40,125 / 39,460. Source-line measures include comments/data, not completed behavior percentages.
- Since the seventeenth steering: 21 owners and 11,512 original lines retired; current glue/tooling totals are above. #427 integrated road-stop #422/shared #424/coverage #426; #434 integrated house/town #416, wagon coverage #431, track/orders #432 and anchors #433. No rollback.
- Latest completed six-count profile is 09eda. Recomputed BOTH 6bb and 09eda under the new quiet-09eda anchors, projections fell 0.290-2.271% on play scenarios; TGP stayed at its floor. At 09eda: TGP 1.138746x, Opus 1.428848x, Grok 1.416843x, P1996 1.321550x, P2000 1.381829x, P2016 1.463012x. No >3% rise; count decreases are not wall savings. The second-integration profile at 156915 is running in the background.
- Quiet 09eda completed four interleaved three-pair medians: 144 exits/72 semantic pairs passed. Opus/P2016 remain in band, all ratios below ceilings. Only the accepted collection held heavy work; no timing hold is active. Current net attribution selected track status and ProcessOrders, now integrated #432; no savings claim before remeasurement. Original raw/cache differences remain explicit: Opus +84,032 Ir, P2016 -5,691,628 Ir.
- Integrated combinations passed exact-current-base Full. Since steering: 40 Full requests, 22 successful, eleven failed and seven cancelled. #427's MSVC class-return fix and #434 both passed; strict protection remains enabled. Both due macOS configurations passed at 6bb; next macOS is due after one more integration. CI observation reached 10/10; broader infrastructure remains unselected. CI_ON_DEMAND stays true.
- Four unintegrated components: common Action2 #425 final-base adoption, airport #428 final validation, generic callbacks #429 implementation and #156 property-boundary coverage #435. Object invocation/eligibility #430 is selected next; fresh Astra planning is selecting following owners. Completed checkout cleanup is 87; protected speed inputs remain until consumed.

## Eighteenth steering review (2026-10-23, remove accidental gates and close shared-layer debt)

Four fresh Codex gpt-6.1-sol/high fidelity audits covered the largest new ports:
#364 generation (1,214 retired), #374 movement (985), #360 rail transactions (864)
and #359 visits (769). A fifth audited process and blockers. These share root's
model family at the user's request; the Opus tasks were stopped. Root verified
load-bearing findings against source, retained reports and transcripts.

- No reachable game-state divergence established. Autorefit restoration allocates a fresh Vec where original assignment reuses capacity. Strict graph lookup was replaced with GetIfValid; ordinary dangling-ID reachability is unproved. Named helper copies and duplicate native leaves remain. Fixing checklist: [#261](https://github.com/fetch-laboratories/openttd-rust/issues/261#issuecomment-6370620352).
- Animation's evidence caught a real airport RNG/SB defect before integration. Keep its accepted package. Nine animation tasks (three planning/inventory), six scheduler tasks and four monitor tasks repeatedly tried to force ratios before accepting necessary boundaries. The infrastructure budget rule had been extended to ordinary owner evidence; AGENTS.md corrects that scope.
- A ready #387 Full waited about 90 minutes for future speed maintenance. Quiet leases covered about 33 minutes for roughly 7.5 minutes of collection. The private 0.25-core cutoff aborted 66 games when an unrelated process used 0.267856 core; no calibration established timing contamination. AGENTS.md restores readiness order and confines holds to actual measurement.
- The speed report compared ac7 against 824's OLD-anchor projection. Recomputing both from the current anchor gives play rises of 4.33-5.37%, not the three previously reported. #275 is the authoritative correction and work list.

Standing corrections from reviews sixteen/seventeen and the later user correction:

| Correction | Verdict and cost versus result |
| --- | --- |
| Merged-tip profiles; no per-PR speed; band-only passes | Applied; identified real cost growth and selected #390. Nonblocking interpretation slipped as above. |
| Strict tested combinations and batching | Applied after the #347/#353 failure; later failed combinations stayed off main. Keep it. 27 Full requests still cost six failed/six cancelled attempts. |
| macOS every fifth integration; focused local checks/free-core jobs | Applied; both due latest-session macOS runs passed without capacity cancellation; no duplicate full local suite found. |
| Infrastructure budgets; proportionate owner evidence | Harmful reinterpretation into three owner ledgers; repeated planning stopped at the same eventual cost explanation. Scope corrected in AGENTS.md. |
| Header helpers, base-type returns, local containers and orphan review | MSVC/scratch fixes landed and reviews removed orphans; helper copies and one allocation slipped through. #261/#281 fixes are selected. |
| #156 standing capacity and #281 tail | Slipped; no dedicated backlog task in the latest session. Assign maintenance/coverage workers before another evidence planner. |
| Clean-base review exemption; stock-take docs | Slipped around clean reconciliation (#380 had an empty remerge diff but another review). Six integrations produced 16 docs commits; use existing exemption and selection/stock-take cadence. |
| Checkpoints, action-based wind-down and rollback | Applied: three unfinished checkpoints preserved; no new CI wait. No eligible rollback in the latest session. |

Disposition: #403 integrated the selected source/checker and coverage fixes plus
three repairs from the completed #275 net attribution. The full quiet-six retry
is complete. #389's probes and base conflict resolution passed fresh scoped
review and integrated exact-current-base Full. Standing #156 work and #259 cleanup
continue. No new profiling controller, raw-map/Vehicle permission or owner cost
ledger was introduced. Its [accepted disposition](https://github.com/fetch-laboratories/openttd-rust/pull/389#issuecomment-6370622209)
remains settled; ready owners do not wait for future speed maintenance.

The 3% trigger and factor 2 remain provisional: observed reference count drift is
about 0.055%, far below this tip's 2.17-2.68% play-work growth. At 032d the factor-2
projections exceeded quiet play ratios by 9.55-19.36%; keep using quiet passes to
decide actual ceiling proximity, not treating projections as wall results.
No user speed/CI/wind-down policy is reversed. The removed gates were agent
interpretations. The requested whole quiet-six retry is now complete. The steer skill
uses the active host's native subagents, whether Codex or Claude Code;
the start-development prompt is unchanged.

## Earlier steering, still in force

Ownership and original observable behavior come first; C++ retains canonical map
arrays except the explicitly audited #274 read descriptor. Preserve original
callees, shared helpers/services, process scope and RNG. No per-call allocation
absent from the original, opcode dispatch, whole-record copies or owner bounces.
Evidence is default semantic checks plus exact-combination CI, with gaps on #156
and original retirement excluding glue (#223). Small maintenance is batched;
reviewers fix source findings and rerun only affected checks. Keep six component
branches maximum, strict protection, no admin merge, automatic bounded rollback,
and action-based wind-down. AGENTS.md is the authoritative rule text.

## Phase 1: selected maintenance and coverage

The semantic harness remains the evidence base. #261/#281 own source-boundary
repairs, #156 owns missing branches, and #275 owns the measured speed work.
Their current selections and readiness order follow below; no separate gate or
new tooling stream is introduced. Keep one worker closing the coverage backlog.

## Phase 2: current work, in order of readiness

Integrate ready reviewed work first. Keep at most six component branches.

1. **#417 / #425 common Action2:** assigned-base whole fidelity review passed. Fresh scoped fixing review merges actual156915 once and adopts integrated road-stop/house/shared-town variables, scopes and PSA directly; remove stale baseline/API leftovers, fix current consumers, run affected checks, then root spot-check/current-base Full. No dependency on airport's draft.
2. **#418 / #428 airport/airport-tile runtime:** first actual-program airport/reload comparison passed, including admission, Built/animation, parent PSA and both RNG streams. Necessary selected-spec helper/cross-owner cost accepted once. Finish exact-callee/duplicate/orphan audit and final affected checks, then fresh whole-owner review/current-base Full. Native hangar/rotation bodies accept selected specs; original gates remain.
3. **#156 coverage, #275 speed, #259 cleanup:** one worker closes integrated vehicle property-boundary gap in #435 using existing fleet scenarios and independent sensitivity checks. Track/orders repairs and complete anchors have integrated; profile156915 and compare09eda under those SAME anchors, attribute only demonstrated >3% rises and run a quiet pass only under AGENTS.md. Ready owners do not wait for future maintenance. Preserve protected inputs; no new infrastructure follows from CI observation10/10.
4. **#429 generic callbacks:** assigned from actual156915; whole ordered registry, AI and ambient runtime, direct tile routes and real default evidence. First concrete boundary/evidence checkpoint gets one cost disposition. Common evaluator remains its currently integrated owner; no draft-service dependency.
5. **#430 object invocation/eligibility next:** whole stack/root/parent/availability owner, without second credit for already-owned variables/animation. Root assigns by readiness/capacity. Fresh Astra planning selects the following two whole simulation owners; root records selection before implementation.

New owners start from integrated rust-migration, never draft services. Root lands
a shared service once; other drafts adopt it at final validation. Core owners
receive a concrete boundary repair or necessary-cost explanation, not circular
deferral. Catchment, #64/#68/#69, vendored libraries, GUI rendering and platform
expansion remain unselected. Completing the list triggers further planning.

## Resume checkpoint

Development is active. #434 merged after exact-current-base Full. No timing
hold is active; builds and semantic checks continue alongside merged-tip counts.

| Item | Saved head | Resume action | Jobs / CI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #425 common Action2 | `1330f4b53d` | Actual156915 adopted; finish scoped direct-owner checks/review, root spot-check and Full. | Fresh fixing review active. |
| #428 airport runtime | `e398d4b2e7` | Final exact-callee/ABI/default checks, then fresh whole review. | Build passed; final focused driver active. |
| #429 generic callbacks | base `1569158485` | Whole registry/AI/ambient ownership and first real default checkpoint. | Fresh implementation active. |
| #156 / #435 | `54f264cc86` | Finish property-boundary sensitivity, restore/check exact head, fresh review. | Initial build/native8/default2 passed. |
| #275 merged-tip profile | `1569158485` | Compare all six projections to09eda under shared new anchors. | Background instruction driver active. |
| #430 / following owners | selected / planning | Object invocation next; root selects two following whole owners from fresh research. | Object queued; Astra/high planning active. |

Preserve protected speed checkouts and exact runtimes until #275 consumes them;
keep the pinned reference unchanged. Root is gpt-6.1-sol xhigh; implementation/
review workers use Sol high, planning Astra high. CI_ON_DEMAND stays true;
macOS is due after one more integration. Old wind-down messages bind only the
stopped session. No current work is paused by them.

## Progress metric

Every port PR records `python3 tools/port-metrics.py`; `--whole-fork` gives totals
and simulation share. Retire more original C++ than net glue plus tooling or
explain the necessary cost after boundary review. Data tables inflate retirement;
judge game logic owned. AGENTS.md governs cost disposition and evidence scope.
